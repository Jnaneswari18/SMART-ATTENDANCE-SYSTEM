# SMART-ATTENDANCE-SYSTEM
Abstract:

1.The Smart Attendance System is a web application designed to automate the process of marking student attendance.
2.It captures a student’s face through a webcam, verifies their presence using face recognition, and validates their location using GPS coordinates to ensure authenticity.
3.The system ensures accurate, tamper-proof attendance marking and stores data securely for future reference.

Introduction:

In most educational institutions, attendance management is still handled manually through roll calls or paper registers. This traditional approach is time-consuming, inefficient, and prone to human error. Moreover, it opens the door to manipulation, such as students marking attendance for their friends or providing false information.

To overcome these limitations, this project introduces a Smart Attendance System that utilizes the power of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) technologies. The system automatically records student attendance by capturing their face.

Additionally, the system integrates GPS-based location validation, ensuring that attendance can only be marked within the college premises, thereby preventing proxy marking from outside locations. This dual verification method — combining face recognition and geolocation tracking — provides a more secure, transparent attendance process.

The Smart Attendance System aims to reduce faculty workload, eliminate fraud entries, and provide a scalable, real-time solution that can be integrated into existing institutional management systems for better efficiency and data accuracy.
